# MLM Library for PHP and MySQL

This library provides an efficient solution for managing MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) clients in a PHP and MySQL environment. It simplifies the process of adding, deleting, and fetching users by utilizing a parallel tree structure that enables quick querying without the need for recursive functions.

When using recursion for an operation to calculate all users at the 23rd level of the binary tree, we will need to perform a recursive traversal of the tree, in the worst case, going through all levels. The complexity of such an algorithm is estimated as O(n * h), where n is the number of users at the level, and h is the height of the tree. In this case, it is equal to 2^23 * 24 â‰ˆ 201,326,592 operations. 

Which will take dozens of hours of work even with powerful servers and optimized code. The technique in this example allows you to speed up calculations to fractions of seconds.

This algorithm solved the problems with calculation and sampling in a large MLM company by reducing the processing time for accrual of rewards from 50 minutes 1 request to 0.3 seconds. Perhaps you just need this solution.

## Requirements

- PHP 8
- MySQL

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP archive and extract it to your desired location.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yinfosave2007/fastmlm.git
```

2. Import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL server to set up the necessary tables.

3. Edit the `config.php` file to configure the database connection settings.

## Usage

The library provides an easy-to-use API through the `UserController` class. You can create, delete, and fetch users using the provided methods. Check the `examples` folder for sample scripts demonstrating the usage of the library.

### Adding a User

```php
$userId = $userController->createUser('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 1);
```

### Deleting a User

```php
$userController->deleteUser($userId);
```

### Fetching Users by Level

```php
$users = $userController->getUsersByLevel($level);
```

### Fetching Users by Rek ID

```php
$users = $userController->getUsersByRekId($rekId);
```

## Running the Examples

In the command line, navigate to the `examples` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
php create_user.php
php delete_user.php
php get_users_by_level.php
php get_users_by_rek_id.php
```

This will execute the respective actions and display the results in the command line.
